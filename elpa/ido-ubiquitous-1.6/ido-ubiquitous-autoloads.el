Use `ido-completing-read' instead of `completing-read' almost everywhere.

  This mode has no effect unles `ido-mode' is also enabled.

  If this mode causes problems for a function, you can force the
  function to use the original completing read by using the macro
  `ido-ubiquitous-disable-in'. For example, if a
  function `foo' cannot work with ido-style completion, evaluate
  the following (for example by putting it in your .emacs file):

    (ido-ubiquitous-disable-in foo)

happen, so this feature may simply not work in some cases.")
