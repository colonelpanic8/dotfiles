# Org / Emacs package constellation

## Scope
- Use this guide for org-related package repos, including `org-window-habit`.
- This is especially relevant when repos are managed through local Emacs package trees.

## Related packages/projects (trigger list)
- If any of these names are mentioned, open this guide for context.
- `org-window-habit`: org habit-tracking package/repo.
- `org-wild-notifier`: org notification package/repo.
- `org-agenda-api`: Emacs Lisp HTTP API project that loads org package deps.
- `elpaca`: Emacs package manager tree where local checkouts may live.
- `elpa`: traditional Emacs package install tree (fallback search area).

## Symlink targets
- `./project-links/org-window-habit` -> org-window-habit repo/root.

## Discovery hints
- Start with Emacs roots, especially `~/.emacs.d`.
- Prefer checking package manager trees (including `elpaca`) before broader searches.
- Common pattern is nested repos under `~/.emacs.d` package directories.

## Read-first docs
- `./project-links/org-window-habit/README.md`
- `./project-links/org-window-habit/README.org` (if present)
