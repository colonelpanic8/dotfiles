# Mova / org-agenda-api constellation

## Scope
- Use this guide for requests involving the mova constellation, including `org-agenda-api`.
- Primary anchor is the mova root repo; start there and branch out.

## Related packages/projects (trigger list)
- If any of these names are mentioned, open this guide for context.
- `mova-dev`: coordination repo for the mova ecosystem and cross-repo workflows.
- `mova`: React Native app (iOS/Android/Web).
- `org-agenda-api`: Emacs Lisp HTTP API and deployment container.
- `org-window-habit`: habit-tracking logic used by org workflows.
- `org-wild-notifier`: org notification logic and scheduling behavior.
- `dotfiles` (within mova-dev context): infra/config and deployment glue for org-agenda-api.

## Symlink targets
- `./project-links/mova-dev` -> mova constellation root.

## Discovery hints
- Check likely roots first, especially `~/Projects`.
- Common local path is `~/Projects/mova-dev`, but do not assume it exists.
- If the symlink is missing or stale, search by directory name first, then by repo names.

## Read-first docs
- `./project-links/mova-dev/README.md`
- `./project-links/mova-dev/org-agenda-api/README.md` (if present)

## Notes
- Prefer treating mova root docs as canonical project context.
