# Prompting best practices

These prompting principles are shared by both top-level modes of the skill:
- built-in `image_gen` tool (default)
- explicit `scripts/image_gen.py` CLI fallback

This file is about prompt structure, specificity, and iteration. Fallback-only execution controls such as `quality`, `input_fidelity`, masks, output format, and output paths live in the fallback docs.

## Structure
- Use a consistent order: scene/backdrop -> subject -> key details -> constraints -> output intent.
- Include intended use (ad, UI mock, infographic) to set the level of polish.
- For complex requests, use short labeled lines instead of one long paragraph.

## Specificity policy
- If the user prompt is already specific and detailed, normalize it into a clean spec without adding creative requirements.
- If the prompt is generic, you may add tasteful detail when it materially improves the output.
- Treat examples in `sample-prompts.md` as fully-authored recipes, not as the default amount of augmentation to add to every request.

## Allowed and disallowed augmentation

Allowed augmentation for generic prompts:
- composition and framing cues
- intended-use or polish-level hints
- practical layout guidance
- reasonable scene concreteness that supports the request

Do not add:
- extra characters, props, or objects that are not implied
- brand palettes, slogans, or story beats that are not implied
- arbitrary side-specific placement unless the surrounding layout supports it

## Composition and layout
- Specify framing and viewpoint (close-up, wide, top-down) and placement only when it materially helps.
- Call out negative space if the asset clearly needs room for UI or copy.
- Avoid making left/right layout decisions unless the user or surrounding layout supports them.

## Constraints and invariants
- State what must not change (`keep background unchanged`).
- For edits, say `change only X; keep Y unchanged` and repeat invariants on every iteration to reduce drift.

## Text in images
- Put literal text in quotes or ALL CAPS and specify typography (font style, size, color, placement).
- Spell uncommon words letter-by-letter if accuracy matters.
- For in-image copy, require verbatim rendering and no extra characters.

## Input images and references
- Do not assume that every provided image is an edit target.
- Label each image by index and role (`Image 1: edit target`, `Image 2: style reference`).
- If the user provides images for style, composition, or mood guidance and does not ask to modify them, treat the request as generation with references.
- If the user asks to preserve an existing image while changing specific parts, treat the request as an edit.
- For compositing, describe how the images interact (`place the subject from Image 2 into Image 1`).

## Iterate deliberately
- Start with a clean base prompt, then make small single-change edits.
- Re-specify critical constraints when you iterate.
- Prefer one targeted follow-up at a time over rewriting the whole prompt.

## Fallback-only execution controls
- `quality`, `input_fidelity`, explicit masks, output format, and output paths are fallback-only execution controls.
- Do not assume they are built-in `image_gen` tool arguments.
- If the user explicitly chooses CLI fallback, see `references/cli.md` and `references/image-api.md` for those controls.

## Use-case tips
Generate:
- photorealistic-natural: Prompt as if a real photo is captured in the moment; use photography language (lens, lighting, framing); call for real texture; avoid over-stylized polish unless requested.
- product-mockup: Describe the product/packaging and materials; ensure clean silhouette and label clarity; if in-image text is needed, require verbatim rendering and specify typography.
- ui-mockup: Describe the target fidelity first (shippable mockup or low-fi wireframe), then focus on layout, hierarchy, and practical UI elements; avoid concept-art language.
- infographic-diagram: Define the audience and layout flow; label parts explicitly; require verbatim text.
- logo-brand: Keep it simple and scalable; ask for a strong silhouette and balanced negative space; avoid decorative flourishes unless requested.
- illustration-story: Define panels or scene beats; keep each action concrete.
- stylized-concept: Specify style cues, material finish, and rendering approach (3D, painterly, clay) without inventing new story elements.
- historical-scene: State the location/date and required period accuracy; constrain clothing, props, and environment to match the era.

Edit:
- text-localization: Change only the text; preserve layout, typography, spacing, and hierarchy; no extra words or reflow unless needed.
- identity-preserve: Lock identity (face, body, pose, hair, expression); change only the specified elements; match lighting and shadows.
- precise-object-edit: Specify exactly what to remove/replace; preserve surrounding texture and lighting; keep everything else unchanged.
- lighting-weather: Change only environmental conditions (light, shadows, atmosphere, precipitation); keep geometry, framing, and subject identity.
- background-extraction: Request a clean cutout; crisp silhouette; no halos; preserve label text exactly; no restyling.
- style-transfer: Specify style cues to preserve (palette, texture, brushwork) and what must change; add `no extra elements` to prevent drift.
- compositing: Reference inputs by index; specify what moves where; match lighting, perspective, and scale; keep the base framing unchanged.
- sketch-to-render: Preserve layout, proportions, and perspective; choose materials and lighting that support the supplied sketch without adding new elements.

## Where to find copy/paste recipes
For copy/paste prompt specs (examples only), see `references/sample-prompts.md`. This file focuses on principles, specificity, and iteration patterns.
